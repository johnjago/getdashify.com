Dashify is an extension for WooCommerce that makes the admin dashboard as powerful and intuitive as Shopify’s.

This is Dashify’s website, built with Hugo and Tailwind CSS.

## Developing

1. Run `npm install` (only the first time).
2. Run `npm run dev` to watch for CSS changes and build the Tailwind CSS output as well as serve the website on a localhost server.
4. Open the localhost URL provided in the terminal.

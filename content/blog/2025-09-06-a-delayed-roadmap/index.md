In our previous blog post, we mentioned that in Q2 2025, the admin theme would be nearly complete, with most of the WooCommerce pages taking on the Dashify theme. We also set the additional goals of making Dashify compatible with WordPress plugin localization as well as improving Dashify’s global search.

However, with Dashify being a project on the side of a full-time job, we’ve found less time to work on it over the past few months than we had hoped. Luckily, we’re finding more time now and are determined to resume where we left off and finish building the core features of the plugin in Q4 2025.

If you’ve sent us an email, left a message on the WordPress.org forum, or contacted us through the Help Desk, rest assured that you will receive a reply within the coming weeks.

Thanks for using Dashify, and expect improvements soon!

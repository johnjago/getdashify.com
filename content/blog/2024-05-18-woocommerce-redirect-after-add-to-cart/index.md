This is a setting that is part of WooCommerce, so no custom code or plugins are required. Follow the steps below to enable this feature in WooCommerce.

1. From the WordPress dashboard, navigate to **WooCommerce → Settings** in the left sidebar.
2. Click on the “**Products**” tab.
3. Near the top, next to “**Add to cart behaviour**”, you’ll see a checkbox labeled “**Redirect to the cart page after successful addition**”. Check the box to enable the feature.
4. Scroll to the bottom and click “**Save changes**”.

After turning this on, when a shopper adds an item to the cart from either the shop page or the product page, they’ll be taken to the cart page after the item is added.

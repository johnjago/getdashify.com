The idea for Dashify came up in December 2023, when we realized that so much of the WooCommerce admin could be improved UI and UX-wise to make store management more efficient, after having used WooCommerce for many years prior.

In January 2024, we released the first version of Dashify, which only restyled the order list and edit pages. It was well received, and we continued building out the Dashify theme, adding a modern style to the subscriptions pages, product list, admin menu, and WooCommerce settings.

This brings us to 2025. For the early part of this year, we focused on building out compatibility, as we know well from many years of working with stores that compatibility is important. WordPress is a plugin ecosystem, and although it has its drawbacks, it allows you to add almost any custom functionality to your site. Especially for plugins critical to your site’s operation, it’s not an option to get rid of them simply to make another plugin work. Each store’s needs are different, and those needs are met by different plugins, so one of our promises with Dashify is to make it as compatible as we can.

With over 600 active installs and many messages of wonderful feedback sent to us, we want to continue building out Dashify to be a powerful, beautiful admin theme that works with minimal hassle out of the box, but that is also customizable if needed.

For these next few months, we’ve identified the following priorities.

## Bringing the theme to the rest of WooCommerce

Not every page in the WooCommerce admin gets styled currently, leading to an incomplete experience.

Unlike other admin theme plugins, we carefully craft the design for each page rather than applying common styles across the entire WordPress admin. This way, we ensure there are no weird gaps or other inconsistencies that detract from a good-looking UI. Because we do this, it takes time and effort to introduce Dashify to more WooCommerce pages. But, it’s clear that this is priority number one for Dashify so that it becomes a complete product.

Out of scope at the moment is bringing the theme to the entire WordPress admin—pages outside of WooCommerce. That is something we’ll look at in Q3 or Q4 2025.

## Admin bar

A completely redesigned admin bar is coming this quarter. Using what we’ve learned from redesigning other parts of the admin. For the admin bar, it’ll be designed with compatibility at the very beginning. All existing functionality that plugins add to the admin bar will be accessible, but we’ll also have the option for it to be cleaned up if you wish. It’ll work with admin bar menu editors as well.

## Localization

We’ve received many requests to make our plugin fully translatable, and we recognize the importance of this for stores across the globe, so we’re going to spend some time redoing the internals of Dashify so that every part of the UI can be translated with your favorite plugins and through translate.wordpress.org.

## Dashify Search

Lastly, a stretch goal will be to improve the Dashify Pro’s global search to at least match parity with the standard WooCommerce search, where you can search for partial matches, for example.

## Roadmap

If you didn’t know, we have a public [Roadmap](/roadmap/) where we list what’s being worked on, what’s coming in the near future, and what’s been suggested.

We’ll keep that updated as priorities change, so you can always take a look there to get a general idea of what to expect for Dashify in the future.

Going forward, I hope to keep sharing these quarterly updates to communicate the thinking around the direction of Dashify.

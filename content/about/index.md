ðŸ‘‹ Hello! Weâ€™re the creators of Dashify.

The idea for Dashify was born when we noticed that WooCommerce store owners could make impressive sites for their shoppers, but couldnâ€™t do the same for themselves in the admin. With limited options for theming the admin, they were left using an interface designed for blog sites that also lacked features compared to other ecommerce platforms.

And so we set out to create Dashify, the WooCommerce extension that transforms the WordPress admin into an ecommerce-centric dashboard, while adding essential ecommerce functionality at the same time.

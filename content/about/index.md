The idea for Dashify, a WooCommerce admin theme, was born when its two creators, John and Sumin, noticed that WooCommerce store owners could make impressive sites for their shoppers—but couldn’t do the same for themselves on the admin side.

Having limited options for admin themes, WooCommerce store owners were left using an interface designed for blog sites, and on top of that, they were missing out on powerful admin features provided by other ecommerce platforms.

With many years of combined experience in WooCommerce and ecommerce, we set out to create Dashify, the WooCommerce extension that transforms the WordPress admin into an ecommerce-centric dashboard.

After a few months of development, Dashify went live in February 2024. It was only a few months before Dashify reached 100 users.

Now, with over 800 stores using Dashify, we know there’s a long road ahead to achieve our vision, but we’re eagerly looking forward to building an even better admin experience.

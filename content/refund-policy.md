We understand that Dashify cannot work perfectly for everyone.

If you are unhappy with your purchase or have an issue that we cannot resolve, we will be happy to consider a refund.

- Refunds will be issued only **within 30 days of the purchase date**.
- After we issue a refund, your license(s) will be cancelled on the same day.
- We can issue a refund if you accidentally forget to cancel a renewal. We send a reminder email before the renewal to help make sure this doesnâ€™t happen.
- Only **one refund per 365 days** for each customer or organization.

To request a refund, send an email to john@getdashify.com, preferably from the email address you signed up with. Keep in mind that there are several products named Dashify out there. **Please make sure you are reaching out about the WooCommerce plugin, and not any other Dashify**.

By purchasing the plugin, you agree to the terms of this Refund Policy.

title = 'Admin Menu Editor compatibility'
+++

Dashify, the admin theme for WooCommerce, is compatible with Admin Menu Editor, both the [free](https://wordpress.org/plugins/admin-menu-editor/) and [paid](https://adminmenueditor.com/) versions.

Dashify has a custom, WooCommerce-focused admin navigation menu that moves WooCommerce to the top and makes important menu items like Orders as part of the primary menu, not inside a submenu.

If you’re using Admin Menu Editor, you probably have a custom menu that you’ve built for yourself or your clients. Perhaps it does something similar to Dashify, perhaps not. But that’s okay! You can keep both the Dashify style *and* your custom menu because if Dashify detects that Admin Menu Editor is turned on, it will use your custom menu instead of the Dashify one.

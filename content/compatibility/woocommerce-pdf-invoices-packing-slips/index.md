Dashify, the admin theme for WooCommerce, is compatible with [PDF Invoices & Packing Slips for WooCommerce](https://wpovernight.com/downloads/woocommerce-pdf-invoices-packing-slips-professional/) by WP Overnight. It is also compatible with the [free version](https://wordpress.org/plugins/woocommerce-pdf-invoices-packing-slips/).

With Dashify, the PDF Invoices menu item can be seen in the left admin menu instead of being hidden inside the WooCommerce submenu, and the PDF actions can also be seen in Dashify’s floating bulk actions.

Also, the PDF Invoices menu item can be seen on the left in the WordPress admin menu.](/compatibility/woocommerce-pdf-invoices-packing-slips/pdf-invoices.png)

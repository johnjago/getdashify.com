We understand that plugin compatibility is important in WordPress. If you’re already using a suite of plugins to run your store, and a new plugin doesn’t work well with them, it’s hard to justify getting that new plugin.

That is why we’ve designed Dashify to be compatible with nearly all admin plugins out of the box.

At the same time, we’ve done extensive testing with select plugins to ensure they work well in Dashify:

- [WooCommerce Subscriptions](/compatibility/woocommerce-subscriptions/)
- [Admin Menu Editor](/compatibility/admin-menu-editor/)
- [PDF Invoices & Packing Slips for WooCommerce](/compatibility/woocommerce-pdf-invoices-packing-slips/)
- [WooCommerce PDF Invoices, Packing Slips, Delivery Notes and Shipping Labels](/compatibility/print-invoices-packing-slip-labels-for-woocommerce/)
- [WooPayments](/compatibility/woocommerce-payments/)
- [Rank Math](/compatibility/seo-by-rank-math/)
- [RD Order Modifier for WooCommerce](/compatibility/rd-wc-order-modifier/)

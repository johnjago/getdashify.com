We understand that plugin compatibility is important in WordPress. If you’re already using a suite of plugins to run your store, and a new plugin doesn’t work well with them, it’s hard to justify getting that new plugin.

That is why we’ve designed Dashify to be compatible with nearly all admin plugins out of the box.

At the same time, we’ve done extensive testing with select plugins to ensure they work well in Dashify:

- [WooCommerce Subscriptions](/compatibility/woocommerce-subscriptions/)
- [PDF Invoices & Packing Slips for WooCommerce](/compatibility/woocommerce-pdf-invoices-packing-slips/)
- [RD Order Modifier for WooCommerce](/compatibility/rd-wc-order-modifier/)

## Want to have your plugin featured here?

[Send us an email](mailto:john@getdashify.com)—we’ll get your plugin tested and added.

## Found an incompatible plugin?

[Send us a support request](https://forms.gle/pRezSbdUcZmvZdX27) and we’ll fix it.

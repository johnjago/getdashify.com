Dashify, the admin theme for WooCommerce, is compatible with [WooCommerce PDF Invoices, Packing Slips, Delivery Notes and Shipping Labels](https://wordpress.org/plugins/print-invoices-packing-slip-labels-for-woocommerce/) by WebToffee.

It’s embedded within the WooCommerce section of the Dashify admin navigation, making it fit right in with the rest of the Dashify theme.

The bulk actions for printing invoices, shipping labels, and more show in Dashify’s floating bulk actions. Lastly, the individual action icons appear in Dashify’s order list.

Additional buttons can be seen that were added by WooCommerce PDF Invoices, Packing Slips, Delivery Notes and Shipping Labels by WebToffee.](/compatibility/print-invoices-packing-slip-labels-for-woocommerce/webtoffe-pdf-invoice-actions.png)

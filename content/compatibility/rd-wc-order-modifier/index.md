Dashify, the admin theme for WooCommerce, is compatible with RD Order Modifier for WooCommerce, both the [paid](https://www.robotdwarf.com/woocommerce-plugins/admin-order-modifier/) and [free](https://wordpress.org/plugins/rd-wc-order-modifier/) versions.

Dashify has also updated the styling of the fields to match the rest of the before/after discount boxes in the line item editor.

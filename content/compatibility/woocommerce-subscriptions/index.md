Dashify, the admin theme for WooCommerce, is compatible with [WooCommerce Subscriptions](https://woocommerce.com/products/woocommerce-subscriptions/).

Both the list of subscriptions and the page to edit subscriptions have been redesigned, while keeping all existing subscriptions functionality.

Dashify also adds graphs that show recent subscription trends. You can see your revenue from subscriptions, newly created subscriptions, and cancelled subscriptions over 30 day, 7 day, 24 hour, and today time periods.

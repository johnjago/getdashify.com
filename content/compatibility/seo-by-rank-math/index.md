Dashify, the admin theme for WooCommerce, is compatible with Rank Math SEO, both the [free](https://wordpress.org/plugins/seo-by-rank-math/) and [paid](https://rankmath.com/) versions.

Rank Math has unique menu items that showcase a status to the right of the menu title.

We’ve made sure these look good in Dashify’s custom navigation to give merchants the most refined visual experience.

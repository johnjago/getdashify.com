## You may be wonderingâ€¦

### When will I hear back?

Dashify is a passion project to make WooCommerce better, and we get lots of
messages, so weâ€™ll do our best to respond as quickly as we can. During busy
times however, it may take **a few weeks**, as this is not our primary
employment. Thank you for your patience and support!

### Do I need to pay for Dashify Pro to get support?

No. We offer free assistance to everyone using Dashify, whether you purchase
the Pro version or not.

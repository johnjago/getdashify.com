With this release of Dashify Pro, you can hide certain custom fields across all orders in WooCommerce.

This is useful if your orders have many custom fields and it’s creating a lot of noise in the order. You can hide the ones that are more “behind the scenes” to create a less cluttered order view.

It lists the custom fields from the order that the window was opened from, and there’s a button to mark a custom field as hidden, which will hide it globally across all orders.](/releases/2024-07-20-hide-custom-fields/hide-custom-fields.webp)

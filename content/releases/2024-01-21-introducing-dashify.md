Dashify, a WooCommerce extension for making the WooCommerce order dashboard look and function as good as Shopify’s, is now [available for download on WordPress.org](https://wordpress.org/plugins/dashify/).

Having worked with both WooCommerce and Shopify stores, I can see that WooCommerce is behind in the user experience on the merchant side. The admin interface for orders is essentially the same as what’s used for blog posts in WordPress. It’s not optimized for ecommerce. But with Dashify, it can be.

Try it out and let me know what you think!

We fixed a couple bugs in this release! 🐞

- If any JS error happened, the page would be blank. Now, it will render the page even if errors are encountered along the way.
- Missing bulk actions and Empty Trash button in trash view have been restored.

By the way, if you’re wondering what happened why we skipped 1.1.1, it’s because there was a problem with WordPress.org and we had to push a new version with no changes.

Until today, Dashify only restyled the order admin pages in WooCommerce. Now, Dashify restyles the product list as well!

This release of Dashify Pro brings us one step closer to a fully redesigned, ecommerce-first admin for WooCommerce.

For example, all searching and filtering happens at the top of the table, after clicking a search and filter icon.](/releases/2024-08-17-restyled-product-list/product-list.png)

### Dashify free vs Pro

Here’s a breakdown of what you can expect in Dashify free vs Pro with regards to which pages are styled.

The free version of Dashify will style the order list and edit, subscription list and edit, and it will have styles for the side navigation, as well as eventually the top admin bar.

The Pro version of Dashify will style the rest of the WooCommerce admin. Today, it starts with the product list, and soon it will include the coupon list and edit, the settings, as well as the “home” dashboard for WooCommerce which will display key store numbers at a glance. Once those pages are done, we’ll turn our attention to the remaining WooCommerce pages. It takes times to do each one because we want to maintain full compatibility will all the plugins that already exist for the WooCommerce admin. But by being diligent with compatibility, we hope to make Dashify a must-have for any store on WooCommerce!

The first version of Dashify Pro is [available for purchase](/#pricing)!

Dashify Pro will eventually extend the free version of Dashify to bring an admin theme to all pages of the WooCommerce admin, not just the orders, and add features for teams and larger stores across the entire WooCommerce admin.

However, *it’s not quite ready yet*, so this is a “soft” release, with just one small feature: making the products in an order sortable by SKU.

In the coming weeks, Dashify Pro will continue to expand.

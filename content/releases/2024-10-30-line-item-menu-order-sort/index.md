This release of Dashify Pro introduces 1 new feature! 🎁

### New features
- You can sort the line items in a customer’s order by the product “menu order”, meaning that in the order, they’ll be sorted the same as they are on the Shop page. There are options to show the items in ascending order, descending order, and no order—where the menu order number will be displayed, but the items won’t be sorted, so it can accommodate any workflow.

*This update requires version 1.3.7 or above of the free version of Dashify.*

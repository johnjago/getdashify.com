If your WordPress admin is set to a language other than English, you may have noticed that Dashify’s custom navigation didn’t fully support it. Some icons may have been missing, and the formatting may have been off.

With this release, Dashify’s admin navigation is now compatible with all WordPress languages. If you’re using the admin in another language, the menu items for WooCommerce—and any other plugin—will be in that language in Dashify’s navigation.

🐞 We also fixed a small bug where the “Add New Product” menu item wasn’t highlighted if using the new WooCommerce product editor.

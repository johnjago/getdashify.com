This release of Dashify Pro introduces 2 improvements and fixes 2 bugs.

### 📈 Improvements
- Added compatibility for TaxJar’s Sync Queue settings.
- Previously after downloading a Dashify update, you may have had to perform a hard refresh to see changes. Now, CSS, JS, and other assets are cache busted upon update, so you’ll see changes right away if there are any.

### 🐞 Bug fixes
- Fixed too much text showing for the Dashify Search admin bar item in admin bar editors.
- Fixed “View version x details” not showing for updates of Dashify Pro.

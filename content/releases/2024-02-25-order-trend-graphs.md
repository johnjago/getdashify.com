Shopify has a nice graph of recent order analytics at the top of the order list. Now, you can have that in WooCommerce too!

This release of Dashify adds recent order analytics for 1, 7, and 30 day periods that display above the order list.

The graph allows you to see trends in refunds, total order count, and more.

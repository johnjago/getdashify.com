This release of Dashify Pro introduces 2 improvements.

### ðŸ“ˆ Improvements
- License status is cached, resulting in a faster admin load since Dashify Pro wonâ€™t have to constantly validate its license.
- If the license server is ever down, Dashify Pro will assume a valid license so as to not disrupt your usage of Dashify Pro.

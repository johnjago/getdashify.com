Today’s update to Dashify Pro expands what you can search by in the global order search.

### Improvements ✨

- In addition to order ID, you can search orders by customer name, email, and phone number.
- Looking for orders that have a specific product? You can search for a product SKU and retrieve all orders containing that product.

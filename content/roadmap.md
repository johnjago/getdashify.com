## üéÅ Working on now

{{< rawhtml >}}
<div class="p-8 border rounded-xl bg-green-50">
	<h3 class="mt-0">Search for orders from anywhere in the WordPress admin</h3>
	<p class="mb-0">Dashify will add a search bar to the top navigation of the WordPress admin, and from that search bar, you will be able to search for orders from any page. Results will be shown as you type.</p>
</div>
{{< /rawhtml >}}

## üü° Up next

{{< rawhtml >}}
<div class="p-8 border rounded-xl bg-yellow-50 mt-4">
	<h3 class="mt-0">Redesigned products, customers, and other WooCommerce pages</h3>
	<p class="mb-0">There is, or used to be, an admin theme out there called Energy+ which styled the entire WordPress dashboard to make it ecommerce focused. Eventually, our goal with Dashify is to do the same and turn the WordPress admin into a powerful ecommerce-focused dashboard.</p>

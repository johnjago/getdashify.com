## üéÅ Up next

These are features we have decided are necessary in order to give merchants the best experience. We‚Äôre either working on them now, or will work on them soon.

<div class="p-8 border rounded-xl bg-green-50">
	<h3 class="mt-0">Ability to change the layout of the order edit page</h3>
	<p class="mb-0">At first, Dashify took inspiration from Shopify for the layout of the order edit page, including how it can‚Äôt be adjusted. Shopify probably did this to optimize the layout and reduce complexity, but in WooCommerce, there are many plugins out there which add custom modules to the order edit page. Some modules make sense to be in a specific position, like at the top, which is currently not possible with Dashify, since Dashify applies its layout when the page loads and doesn‚Äôt consider modules from other plugins. <b>We will soon restore the ability to drag and drop the modules on the order edit screen to preferred locations</b>.</p>

<div class="p-8 border rounded-xl bg-green-50 mt-4">
	<h3 class="mt-0">Order table columns will fit their content</h3>
	<p class="mb-0">Currently, each column in the order table is given a certain width, which may be too wide or too small for the content. When it‚Äôs too wide, it requires unecessary scrolling and makes it harder to see what associates with what. When it‚Äôs too small, important information is cut off. With this feature, <b>Dashify will automatically make the order table columns fit their content, giving a compact and optimized view of all order information</b>.</p>

## ü§î Under consideration

{{< rawhtml >}}
<div class="p-8 border rounded-xl bg-yellow-50 mt-4">
	<h3 class="mt-0">Styling the whole WooCommerce admin</h3>
	<p class="mb-0">There is (or used to be) an admin theme out there called Energy+ which styled the entire WordPress dashboard to make it ecommerce focused. Eventually, our goal with Dashify is to do the same and turn the WordPress admin into a <b>powerful ecommerce-focused dashboard</b>. However, we want to start our improvements with specific pages first, so that we can learn from them and make the rest of it even better.</p>
